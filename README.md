## About me :D

Hi, my name is Nuno. I have 4 years of experience as a QA Games Tester, specializing in mobile and multi-platform game testing. My journey in QA has allowed me to develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills, along with expertise in both manual and automated testing. I have experience working in agile environments (SCRUM) and a deep understanding of game testing methodologies.

Before transitioning into the tech industry, I served as a Communications Specialist in the Portuguese Air Force for almost 6 years, where I was responsible for managing secure communications and handling encrypted transmissions. This role helped me develop discipline, attention to detail, and the ability to work under pressure. Qualities that I carry into my QA career.

I am currently exploring python, cloud technologies, AWS, and machine learning to expand my technical skill set and stay ahead in the evolving QA landscape. In this portfolio, I will share my knowledge and showcase practical projects, including automation scripts and test cases that I have developed.
